    <div id="tribute-info"><p>Chris Kyle (1974â€“2013) was a highly decorated U.S. Navy SEAL sniper and author. Born in Odessa, Texas, he grew up with a passion for rodeo and hunting. After enlisting in the Navy in 1999, Kyle served four tours in Iraq during the Iraq War, where his exceptional marksmanship earned him the nickname "The Legend." He is credited with 160 confirmed kills, making him the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history.
  
  Kyle retired from the military in 2009 and dedicated his post-service life to helping fellow veterans. He wrote an autobiography, *American Sniper*, which became a bestseller and was later adapted into a Hollywood film. Tragically, Kyle was killed in 2013 by a fellow veteran he was trying to help cope with PTSD. His life remains a symbol of service, sacrifice, and dedication to his country and comrades.</p></div>
